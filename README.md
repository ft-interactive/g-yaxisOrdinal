# yaxisOrdinal

Pre styled and positioned linear y-axis for use with the FT's g-chartframe architecture as part of the Visual Vocabulary. As the name suggests it creates a linear y-axis that can be appended to the .plot obejct in the g-chartframe hopefully eliminating the need to code another standard y-axis.

Will also work with other builds where the axis is called into an svg.
